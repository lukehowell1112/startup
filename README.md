# Subscription Manager

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application is meant to help with monthly subscriptions, so that one doesn't get lost in their subcription finances. A user will be able to see a list view of all their subscriptions and have teh ability to delete a subscription or add one. When adding a subscription, a user will be prompted to input the frequency, fixed billing amount, billing period, next charge date, category, and notes. The user will also be able to view a spending summary across all subscriptions, with a recurring billing simulation. This application will also include free trial tracking, where a user can input a free trial that they signed up for, and will notify the user a couple days before the firee trial expires.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features

### Elevator pitch

Don't you just love having the ability to have numerous streams of media all at the access of your hands through subscriptions, however may feel the overbearing weight of not knowing how much it is all costs? Or wonder if you are still paying for a subscription that you stopped using months or years ago? The Subscription Tracker appliaction makes it vary easy to track your subscription expenses and organize them all into one place. Allowing you to centralize subscription tracking, calculate true monthly costs, while also sending reminders for trials and renewals. This easily converts a blind spot in finances to a simple instrument board.
